                governmental authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto

                services Taxes, consumption Taxes, and any withholding Taxes imposed by any government authority on
                Your use of or license to the Software and Documentation and on any payments made by You to Inductive
                Automation with respect thereto, excluding, however, income Taxes on profits which may be levied
                against Inductive Automation. If You are exempt from value-added or sales tax, then You must provide
                a valid, timely, and executed exemption certificate, direct pay permit, or other such
                government-approved documentation to Inductive Automation. Upon Your reasonable request, Inductive
                Automation shall provide you with a duly executed and properly completed IRS Form W-9. If You are
                required by Law to make any income tax deduction or to withhold income tax, after the application of
                reductions or exemptions available under applicable Law or international treaties, from any sum
                payable directly to Inductive Automation hereunder, You will promptly effect payment thereof to the
                applicable tax authorities, You will promptly provide Inductive Automation with official tax receipts
                or other evidence issued by the applicable tax authorities, and You will increase the sum payable to
                Inductive Automation as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including
                such deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this section), Inductive
                Automation receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or
                withholding been made. For the avoidance of doubt, You are responsible for, and will indemnify
                Inductive Automation for, any Taxes, including withholding Taxes, resulting from making licenses
                available to users in geographic regions outside the country in which You are located.

                <strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision of this EULA is found by a competent judicial
                authority to be unenforceable in any respect, such provision will be limited or eliminated to the
                minimum extent necessary so that the remainder of this EULA will continue in full force and effect.

                <strong>Waiver.</strong> The failure by either party to enforce any provision of this EULA will not be
                construed as a waiver of such provision. No waiver of any rights under this EULA will be effective
                unless in writing signed by both parties, and the waiver of any breach or default will not constitute
                a waiver of any other right under this EULA or any subsequent breach or default.

                suggestions for changes or enhancements (collectively, “<strong>Feedback</strong>”) in the course of
                using or evaluating the Software or Documentation, You agree that such Feedback may be used by

                <strong>Your Responsible Claims.</strong> You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Inductive

                agents, successors, licensors and assigns against any losses, claims, damages, fines, and costs
                (including attorney’s fees and expenses) relating in any way to Your Responsible Claims; provided,
                that Inductive Automation reserves the right, in its sole discretion and at its own expense, to assume
                the exclusive defense and control of any claims (and without limiting Your indemnification obligations
                with respect to such claims), and You agree to reasonably cooperate as requested by Inductive
                Automation in the defense of any claims.

            <li>
                <strong>Force Majeure.</strong> Neither party will be in default nor liable for any delay or failure
                to comply with this EULA due to a natural disaster, pandemic, war or act of terrorism, act of
                government, or other circumstance beyond the reasonable control of the affected party (each a
                “<strong>Force Majeure Event</strong>”) for the duration of the Force Majeure Event; provided, that
                such party promptly notifies the other party of the occurrence of the Force Majeure Event.
                Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Force Majeure Event does not permit You to delay or fail to comply
                with Your payment obligations under this EULA unless the Force Majeure Event results in the inability
                of the banking system to process payments.

                indicating Your acceptance electronically or upon Your downloading, installing or using a new version
                of the Software. If You do not want to accept the terms of the amended EULA, then You will not be able
                to use the new version of the Software, but You may continue using Your old version of the Software
                under the terms of the EULA previously accepted by You.

                will be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction sitting in
                Sacramento, California. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
                does not apply to this EULA. Each party consents to the personal jurisdiction, venue and convenience
                of such courts.

                <strong>Counsel; Interpretation.</strong> The parties and their respective counsel have had an
                opportunity to review this EULA. The parties acknowledge and agree that: (i) the rule of construction
                to the effect that any ambiguities are resolved against the drafting party will not be employed in the
                interpretation of this EULA; and (ii) the terms and provisions of this EULA will be construed fairly
                as to all parties hereto and not in favor of or against any party, regardless of which party was
                generally responsible for the preparation of this EULA. The section headings used in this EULA are for
                convenience and reference only and do not form part of this EULA. A word importing the singular
                includes the plural and vice versa. The word “including” will be interpreted to mean “including
                without limitation”.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Independent Status of the Parties.</strong> The parties are independent contractors. This EULA
                does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship
                between the parties. Each party will be solely responsible for payment of all compensation owed to its
                employees, as well as all employment-related taxes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>License Rights Applicable to the U.S. Government.</strong> The Software and Documentation are
                commercial products that were developed exclusively at private expense. If the Software and
                Documentation are acquired directly or indirectly for use by the U.S. Government, then the parties
                agree that the Software and Documentation are considered ‘Commercial Items’ and ‘Commercial Computer
                Software’ or ‘Computer Software Documentation’, as defined in 48 C.F.R. §2.101 and 48 C.F.R.
                §252.227-7014(a)(1) and (a)(5), as applicable. The Software and Documentation may only be used under
                the terms and conditions of this EULA as required by 48 C.F.R. §12.212 and 48 C.F.R. §227.7202. The
                U.S. Government will only have the rights set forth in this EULA, which supersedes any conflicting
                terms or conditions in any government order document, except for provisions which are contrary to
                applicable mandatory federal Laws. Inductive Automation will not be required to obtain a security
                clearance or otherwise be involved in accessing U.S. Government classified information.
